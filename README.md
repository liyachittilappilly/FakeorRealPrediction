## 🔍 What I Built

This project demonstrates how to build a robust text classification pipeline to distinguish real news articles from fake ones.
Key skills strengthened through this project include:

* Text preprocessing and cleaning
* Feature extraction with TF-IDF Vectorizer
* Training and evaluating a Linear SVM classifier
* Achieving high accuracy with real-world data
